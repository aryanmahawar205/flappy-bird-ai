# Flappy Bird AI

**Flappy Bird AI** is a project where an AI agent learns to play the popular game **Flappy Bird** using **reinforcement learning** techniques. The agent trains through trial and error, optimizing its performance by receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions in the game. Over time, the AI learns to navigate obstacles and maximize its score, demonstrating the power of machine learning in mastering game environments.

This project utilizes libraries like **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** for training the model and implements deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as **Q-Learning** or **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**.
