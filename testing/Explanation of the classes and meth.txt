Explanation of the classes and methods:

Bird class:

IMGS: List of images for the bird, used for animation.
MAX_ROTATION: Maximum tilt angle for the bird when it falls.
ROT_VEL: Rotation velocity, controlling how fast the bird tilts.
ANIMATION_TIME: Determines the speed at which the bird switches between frames in the animation.
Methods:

__init__: Initializes the bird's position, physics, and other necessary variables.
jump: Sets the bird's vertical velocity for a jump (negative value to move upward).
move: Updates the bird's vertical position using basic physics, adjusts tilt, and handles terminal velocity.
draw: Handles the bird's animation and drawing to the screen.
get_mask: Returns a mask for collision detection (used for pixel-perfect collisions).
Drawing the window:

draw_window: This function handles rendering the game window, background, and bird.
Main Game Loop:

main: Initializes the game, starts the game loop, handles events, updates the bird's movement, and redraws the window on each iteration.
This code creates the basic mechanics for the Flappy Bird game, including the bird's movement and animation.
